Postdoc. I received my Ph.D. from the School of Mathematical Sciences at University of Science and Technology of China, where I was advised by Prof. Ligang Liu and Prof. Xiaoming Fu. My research focuses on geometry processing and optimization, including surface parameterization, developable surface generation, and physcial simulation. I have published multiple papers at international conferences and journals in computer graphics.
